Kafka is an event driven sytem, that is mainly geared towards data-streaming services in realtime applications.
It stores events as key-value pairs ie 
Event key: "BreakCore"
Event value: "Dissassociative Windows Lucki remix breakcore type beat"
Event timestamo: "01:59 2025-09-14 02:00"

Producers are services that write to Kafka
Consumers are services that subscribe to these events

Events in kafka are stored in `Topics`
